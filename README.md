U-mee flutter HackAThon

## Description

This project is a newsfeed app that emulates a social media app (at least the front end part of it)

to run the app, have a virtual android or physical (virtual is preferred) device. When the program
is ran, it should display the app with no posts. in the bottom right corner is an add button (plus icon), which
allows someone to write their name and a text post. These posts are put at the top of the screen. 
when a post is posted, you can like and unlike the post using the thumbs up / down icon. To comment,
press the comment icon and you should be able to post a comment, similar to a post. The posts and 
comments should be saved even if the app is closed and reopened. 

I decided to keep this really simple as it is my first time actually using flutter. The UI is 
clean and simple as the purpose is to clearly show the specified functionalities that are in the app. I added 
some icons just to make the app look a little bit better. However, since I had only three days,
especially during weekdays with classes, I was only able to do so much with designing the app.
